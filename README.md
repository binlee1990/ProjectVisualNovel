# ProjectVisualNovel
Built on top of a previously started project, https://github.com/wizered67/fencing-magician, the goal of this project is to recreate many of the elements common in **visual novels** in a [LibGDX game] (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). Visual Novels are a type of video games that feature little gameplay and instead is made mostly of dialogue, with most interaction being in the form of making choices that influence the story in some way. This project was inspired by visual novels such as *Ace Attorney* and *Dangan Ronpa* and some of the ideas used in structuring the conversation files were based on *Ren'PY*, a Python engine for making visual novels. 

I chose to make this project instead of using something like Ren'Py for several reasons. Writing the command interpreter myself allows me to have much more control and allows me to imlement commands however I feel is most convenient. Commands that would be inconvenient or impossible in Ren'Py can be implemented more easily. Additionally, writing this on top of LibGDX means that I can add any other gameplay I want in addition to the dialogue system. As such, extracting code from this project would allow me to make dialouge systems for any type of game, not just visual novels. And perhaps most importantly, I thought it would be good experience to try doing something like this myself. There's no point reinventing the wheel, but learning to make a better wheel is still useful.
